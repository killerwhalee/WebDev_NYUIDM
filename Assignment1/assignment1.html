                    Dry Photography
                </h3>
                <p>
                    During that time, wet photography was prevalent, and efforts were underway to develop dry film photography. However, today, we live in a world with electric film technology, offering nearly limitless shots in a compact, dry format. Such technological advancements would have been unimaginable, even less than fifty years ago when the first digital camera was introduced.

                    With the evolution in the quality and quantity of archiving through images, the speed of accumulating human knowledge is skyrocketing. Thanks to its compact size, ease of use, and the ability to easily share pictures via the internet, our connections between individuals have never been stronger.

                <p>
                    Managing and analyzing large amounts of data can indeed be challenging, as it often involves complex mathematical and statistical knowledge to derive meaningful insights. Data analysis is typically carried out by experts in fields such as data science, statistics, and analytics. However, the accessibility of data analysis tools and resources has improved over time, making it more approachable for individuals without advanced expertise.

                <h3>
                    Associative Indexing
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Associative indexing is a key feature of the Memex concept. It refers to the ability to link related pieces of information or documents together through associative trails. Users can create connections between different pieces of information, allowing for non-linear and intuitive exploration of knowledge. Associative indexing enables users to follow a chain of associations to access related information, promoting creativity and facilitating more flexible and efficient information retrieval compared to traditional linear indexes. It's a fundamental concept that underlies modern hypertext systems and the interconnected nature of the internet.

                <p>
                    Wikipedia is a prime example of associative indexing. Any internet user can join the wiki to contribute their knowledge or link it to other articles. With contributions from many people, Wikipedia continues to expand over time.

                Conclusion
            </h3>
            <p>
                Almost everything that Bush predicted has been developed or invented in just 70 years. His term 'Memex' became a reality, renamed as the 'smartphone'. It appears that the pace of technological advancement is accelerating rapidly. Unlike Bush, I fear I cannot predict what will be introduced even in the next ten years. Rapid technological progress can benefit human civilization, but without pauses for reflection, humans may struggle to cope with the technology they create.
