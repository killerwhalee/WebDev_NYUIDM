                <p>
                    In this essay, Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, reflects on the history and significance of the web. He emphasizes the importance of preserving the core principles of the web, including openness, accessibility, and decentralization.

                    Berners-Lee discusses the challenges facing the web, including threats to net neutrality, concerns about privacy and security, and the rise of walled gardens and closed platforms. He highlights the need for an open and neutral internet where information is freely accessible to all.

                    The article also touches on the idea of linked data, which envisions a web where data is interconnected and can be easily accessed and utilized by machines. Berners-Lee believes that this evolution of the web can lead to new opportunities for innovation and collaboration.

                <p>
                    Overall, the article calls for vigilance in protecting the web's fundamental principles to ensure that it continues to be a powerful force for positive change and innovation in the world. Berners-Lee's message is one of optimism and a commitment to maintaining the web as a platform for knowledge sharing and collaboration.

                <h2>Thoughts</h2>

                <p>
                    In the article, he emphasizes that the internet should be a space for everyone, regardless of their location. To achieve this universality and the decentralized nature of the internet, he argues that any form of interference with the internet should be prohibited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The internet connects people across the globe within seconds, bridging vast distances. This speed and barrier-free access to the internet enhance its potential to become an optimal space for knowledge and information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although there exists several side-effects by internet, I expect the positive and optimistic effect would be much larger, as Berners-Lee expected.
