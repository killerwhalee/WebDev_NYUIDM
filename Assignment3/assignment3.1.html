                        Nowadays, every artwork is replicated and spread through various media such as television, magazines, and especially the internet. This means people don't have to go to a museum or gallery to see a masterpiece; they can consume it in their homes while sitting and eating breakfast.

                        Some might worry that this could compromise the integrity of the artwork because it's no longer a unique work but is continuously manufactured and consumed in the same way as factory-produced items. However, I believe it doesn't diminish the value of the work but provides many different ways to experience and engage with the artwork. This replication allows people to enjoy the artwork in various ways and can even inspire them to remember and, furthermore, create their own replicas using editing tools such as Photoshop.

                        Thanks to technology, artwork is no longer confined to the gallery, trapped inside a frame. It now extends to the glow of a television, the fabric of a T-shirt, or the surface of a coffee mug. Perhaps this era does not signify the demise of art but rather marks a new era for art, brimming with infinite opportunities for uniqueness and diversity!
