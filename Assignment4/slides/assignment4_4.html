                <p style="font-size: 20px;" > I find this artwork interesting as it appears to symbolize the way the internet disseminates information or data to a wide audience. We consume vast amounts of information via the internet without often considering the original source of the content. Some may assume that the information they consume originates from the source itself, but they overlook a significant aspect of the internet â€“ information is rarely propagated while preserving its original form. With countless internet users, information undergoes changes, often being edited or abbreviated. Even the final form of the content may be markedly different from the original. This characteristic seems to enrich the world of content with diversity, yet we must be cautious of its potentially destructive power. When anyone can modify information without a clear attribution, it renders the entire body of information unreliable. The deluge of information is blurred and loses its meaning, much like the obscured view deep inside the layered window,  represented in the artwork.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 20px;" > The infinitely overlapped window illustrates how data spreads across the internet, while the desktop itself showcases how data is authored and stored on individual users' computers. A user's computer is one of the sources from which the entire flow and wave of information originates. However, without the internet, this flow would remain dormant, calmly stored within one's computer's hard drive. This is why the artwork `desktop 1` seems more calm and peaceful than `desktop 2`.
