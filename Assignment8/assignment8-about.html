            <h1>About This Website</h1>
            <p>I enjoy taking pictures. Additionally, I like sharing my photographs with others and witnessing people derive pleasure from my photography. This is the motivation behind creating this website.</p>
            <p>I capture anything I find worth immortalizing on film. Consequently, there isn't a specific theme for the pictures, making it somewhat challenging to discern the overarching message conveyed by this collection of photos. To address this, I have incorporated a 'categorizing' feature on the website. You can easily select a keyword from the list to view pictures that fall within the chosen category.</p>
            <p>Given the substantial number of pictures I've taken, it's not feasible to display every picture on a single page, especially considering the large file sizes that could significantly impact website traffic. To tackle this issue, I have 'compressed' each picture into a tile, using the dominant color from the image. The tile not only serves as a compressed representation but also features a keyword that represents the color.</p>
            <p>I hope you derive much enjoyment from exploring my pictures and this web gallery!</p>
