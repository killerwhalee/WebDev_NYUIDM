            As Bush predicted, our technology has reached its peak. Encyclopedias are now compressed to the size of a needle tip, and we can take pictures with a camera the size of a coin. Instead of large libraries, we now have libraries of compressed data cells, with each cell capable of containing an entire library.

            Our approach to knowledge has evolved significantly from the past. While obtaining and preserving knowledge was crucial in earlier times, we now find ourselves amidst a 'data flood.' Our advanced technology has made it challenging to discern what's truly valuable amid this wealth of information. Today, the key lies in identifying what is truly significant and valuable in this sea of data.
